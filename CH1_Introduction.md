## Embedded systems

Special-purpose computer system designed to perform one or a few dedicated functions, sometimes with real-time computing constraints.

It's also important the model of the physical process (in order to predict the computer behaviour).

Modern language have Predictable timing or a way to handle timing. Old languages such as C or Java (these are general purpose programming languages) does not provide time handling, some libraries were developed later on for such purposes.

## V-shape development cycle V-model

**User requirements** As close to the user language **Functional specifications** **Functional modeling**

    The system is modeled using models and parameters of the enviroment.

**Architecture Exploration**     Defines the architecture that supports the execution of this functionality, such as (microncontroller architecture, peripherals, where the microncontrollers are gonna be purchased from).

    Also it defines the *functionality* over the architecture, where and when the functions will be executed.

**Component Modeling** Design the component, model the **behaviour inside them** and then **implement** (*Code*) the components either harware or software, accordingly.

**Validation** The user confirms the software functionality.

V-model_ allows tracing errors at early stage because the test statements and conditions are written at each level of the development.Intro and Requirements
